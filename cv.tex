\section{Personal statement}
{\parindent=1cm
  \begin{adjustwidth}{\hintscolumnwidth+\separatorcolumnwidth}{}
    \noindent I am person passionate about something new. I love to learn. As a programmer I am passionate about bleeding-edge technologies.

    Several years ago, while all my colleagues were programming in PHP, I started to learn and develop in Ruby. Later Ruby became my main programming language. Doing my Ruby projects every work day I began to learn something new besides Ruby. That's how I found Functional Programming~---~Erlang, Haskell and Common Lisp. Than was Scala and Clojure. Full list could be long enough.

    I am trying to experiment with every single technology I have a chance to work. Coding in Scala for Android with working ProGuard obfuscation? Sure! Compiling a working OS X Application with a Go binary with Cocoa bindings? Let's make it possible. Exciting research tasks are the best tasks for me. But I am trying to stay reasonable, to have an open mind~---~there is no ``silver'' bullet, every tool has its task and vice versa.

    Currently I am really excited Google's Go programming language. It got me with its simplicity and speed. I have an awesome experience building a RESTful API with it. But, to be honest, I don't think it's a good language for building a complex web-site. I've coded some minor libraries in Go for my own use and for learning purposes, also there is one tiny very specific web-service~---~\underline{\href{http://xamleeg.kavu.ru/}{\itshape Xamleeg}}. I am trying to actively participate in our local Go community.

    Apart from my desire to learn I eager to help people, to teach them, share my experience, provide my opinion, if needed. During my university years I assisted my professor to conduct practical seminars. I was willing to stay as a teacher after graduating from the university, but due to budget cuts our department couldn't offer me any position at that moment.

    So, now I am looking for job where I can learn from people smarter than me, try new technologies and languages with them, build new great things together and share my experience with people afterwards.
